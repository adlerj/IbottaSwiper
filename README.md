The Project
---
Your goal is to build a mobile application for the platform of your choice (between iOS and Android), using the provided JSON data for Offers, Retailers, and Store Locations. 

We are looking for you to do something creative with the data provided. Your work should reflect your experience with the platform selected. 

* There should be at least a few screens for a user to navigate through. 
* You can target the latest, or a very recent, version of the operating system. 
* You should assume the app will run on varying screen sizes, excluding tablets. 
* Feel free to pull in any libraries you'd like to assist in the development of your project.
* You do not need to make use of every attribute on every object. Just use whatever you need for your project.

Notes on the Data Provided:

 * Offers.json contains Offer objects. Each Offer contains details about itself such as description, amounts, etc. Offers have an attribute, "retailers", which relate to the Retailers they are available at.
 * Retailers.json describe general information about a store where an Offer will be available, such as its name, image asset, etc.
 * Store Locations.json give you location data for specific Retailers. For example, Walmart has several physical store locations. Each object in Store Locations.json gives you geolocation data for a physical store, and what Retailer it is referring to.
